Known Bugs:

- Players cannot get to the last tile.

- The player sometimes skips the split tile, or does not go to it even if it has enough spaces to
move after rolling the die. Just very weird behaviour.

EXAMPLE: Lets say the blue player is on tile 10. Blue player rolls a 6 and gets the prompt to choose their path.
However, the blue player does not move and is still on tile 10. On the players next turn, they roll a 2, however, 
it looks like the player moved 8 tiles. So it seems that the first die roll did not get counted until after choosing their path.

- After the split tile, the player sometimes moves way more than the amount told on the die.
